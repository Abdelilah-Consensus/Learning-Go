# 🔗 Consensus Layer Specialist

## 👨‍💻 About Me

Focused **Consensus Layer Developer** building expertise in blockchain consensus mechanisms and their implementation. My learning path is strategically designed to master the foundational and intermediate concepts needed for production-ready consensus layer development.

## 🎯 Specialization

**Primary Focus:** Consensus Layer Architecture & Implementation

I'm taking a **targeted approach** to learning:
- ✅ Mastering **111+ core consensus layer concepts** (Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced fundamentals)
- ✅ Learning **Go essentials** specifically for consensus implementation
- 🔄 Advanced concepts will be acquired through real-world projects post-employment

## 📚 Current Learning Journey

### Consensus Layer Concepts
- **Completed:** Block structure, Blockchain fundamentals, Genesis block
- **In Progress:** 111 production-ready concepts across three levels
  - 17 Beginner concepts
  - 48 Intermediate concepts  
  - 46 Advanced fundamentals

### Go Programming
- Learning Go **pragmatically** - focusing on what's essential for consensus layer development
- Implementing types, structs, and patterns specific to blockchain systems

## 💡 Philosophy

> "Depth over breadth. Mastery before complexity."

I believe in **building strong foundations** before moving to advanced topics. Every concept I implement, I can explain and defend.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Go
- **Focus Area:** Consensus Layer
- **Approach:** Production-ready fundamentals first

## 📈 Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Current):** Master 111 core concepts + Go essentials
**Phase 2 (Post-Employment):** Advanced consensus mechanisms in production environments
